# Magic Words Puzzle Solver and Generator

## Overview
This project is centered around the implementation of a solver and generator for the "Magic Words" puzzle using Prolog. It explores combinatorial logic and pattern matching, key strengths of Prolog.

## Key Components
- `MagicWords.pl`: The main Prolog file where the core logic of the solver and generator is implemented.
- `Tests.pl`: This file contains tests for the program and imports `MagicWords.pl`.

## Definitions
A 'word' in this context is defined as a finite sequence of strictly positive integers. The project involves manipulating these words, finding prefixes, factors, and other combinatorial aspects relevant to the puzzle.

## Running the Program
1. Install SWI-Prolog from [SWI-Prolog website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Start SWI-Prolog by typing `swipl`.
4. Load the main program file: `[magic_words].`
5. Interact with the program as per the provided documentation or instructions.

Ensure that you follow the specific rules and logic as outlined in the project for interacting with the solver and generator, for more information -> `README.md`
